# What is this ?

A JavaScript environment where AvdanOS Search extensions can run.

## Features :
- API
    - OS Integration
        - Clipboard Access [.]
        - File System Access [.]
    - Network Access [.] 

## Executables
An extension can use any program, as long as it is listed in the extension's manifest file. If a extension attempts to run a command that is not listed in its manifest file, a SecurityException is thrown.


This both allows for fetching of dependencies, and for (slightly) better safety. 

### Example
A extension which gives the user an option to download YouTube videos has a command-line dependency of `youtube-dl` or `yt-dlp`.

Therefore, in the extension's `manifest.avdan` file, it must declare the following in the `dependencies` section 

## Core dependencies
### Clipboard:
- xclip
### Window Management
- xdotool
